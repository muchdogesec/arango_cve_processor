Currently we link CVEs to CAPEC traversing CWEs. e.g. CVE -> CWE -> CAPEC

This is problematic for us and user as there is no direct link from CVE to CAPEC.

We should link cve to capecs using the same traversal, but instead generate an SRO at the end of the process to make a direct link between CVE -> CAPEC

This can be done using CTI Butler.

Firstly, we check all CVE->CWE relationships where `_arango_cve_processor_note` = `cve-cwe` and source_ref = CVE being considered (this mode therefore required arango cve processor `cve-cwe` mode to be run first to work

Secondly, all CWE IDs linked to the CWE are stored, and run against the CTI Butler CWE relationship endpoint with `_arango_cti_processor_note` filter = `cwe-capec` (required https://github.com/muchdogesec/ctibutler/issues/50)

This will return SROs listing all capecs as `target_refs`. You can then use these IDs to get the CAPECs via

```
/api/v1/capec/objects/{capec_id}/
```

This object can then be imported to the CVE collection.

Then ACVEP created an SRO as follows to link CVE to CAPEC directly

```json
{
    "type": "relationship",
    "spec_version": "2.1",
    "id": "relationship--<UUIDV5 GENERATION LOGIC>",
    "created_by_ref": "<IMPORTED IDENTITY OBJECT>",
    "created": "<vulnerabilities.cve.published>",
    "modified": "<vulnerabilities.cve.lastModifiedDate>",
    "relationship_type": "exploited-using",
    "source_ref": "vulnerability--<CVE VULNERABILITY OBJECT>",
    "target_ref": "<CAPEC VULNERABILITY OBJECT>",
    "description": "<CVE name> <relationship_type without - char> <CACEC name>",
    "object_marking_refs": [
        "marking-definition--94868c89-83c2-464b-929b-a1a8aa3c8487",
        "<MARKING DEFINITION IMPORTED>"
    ]
}
```
