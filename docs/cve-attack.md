Currently we link CVEs to ATT&CK traversing CWEs. e.g. CVE -> CWE -> CAPEC -> ATT&C

This is problematic for us and user as there is no direct link from CVE to ATT&CK

We should link cve to att&cks using the same traversal, but instead generate an SRO at the end of the process to make a direct link between CVE -> ATTACK

This can be done using CTI Butler / Vulmatch

Firstly, we check all CVE->CAPEC relationships where `_arango_cve_processor_note` = `cve-capec` and source_ref = CVE being considered (this mode therefore required arango cve processor `cve-capec` mode to be run first to work

Secondly, all CAPEC IDs linked to the CVE are stored, and run against the CTI Butler CAPEC relationship endpoint with `_arango_cti_processor_note` filter = `capec-attack` (required https://github.com/muchdogesec/ctibutler/issues/50)

This will return SROs listing all ATT&CKS as `target_refs`. You can then use these IDs to get the ATT&CKs via

```
/api/v1/attack-enterprise/objects/{attack_id}/
```

This object can then be imported to the CVE collection.

Then ACVEP created an SRO as follows to link CVE to ATT&CK directly

```json
{
    "type": "relationship",
    "spec_version": "2.1",
    "id": "relationship--<UUIDV5 GENERATION LOGIC>",
    "created_by_ref": "<IMPORTED IDENTITY OBJECT>",
    "created": "<vulnerabilities.cve.published>",
    "modified": "<vulnerabilities.cve.lastModifiedDate>",
    "relationship_type": "exploited-using",
    "source_ref": "vulnerability--<CVE VULNERABILITY OBJECT>",
    "target_ref": "<ATT&CK VULNERABILITY OBJECT>",
    "description": "<CVE name> <relationship_type without - char> <ATT&CK name>",
    "object_marking_refs": [
        "marking-definition--94868c89-83c2-464b-929b-a1a8aa3c8487",
        "<MARKING DEFINITION IMPORTED>"
    ]
}
```
